# VENDOR FINANCE — EPC & EQUIPMENT STRUCTURING

## SunFarm PV 50 MW

---

## Overview

Vendor financing reduces the immediate equity requirement by deferring payment to equipment suppliers or EPC contractors. This is standard practice in utility-scale solar where tier-1 manufacturers and EPCs compete for project pipeline.

## Aggregate Vendor Finance Potential

| Category | Value | Deferrable Portion | Deferred Amount |
|---|---|---|---|
| Modules | $19.8M | 15% | $2.97M |
| Inverters | $3.5M | 10% | $0.35M |
| BESS | $8.25M | 20% | $1.65M |
| EPC holdback | $42.0M | 7% | $2.94M |
| **Total** | | | **$7.91M** |

This $7.9M in deferred payments reduces the day-one equity requirement and improves IRR.

## Impact on Capital Structure

| Scenario | Equity Required | Levered IRR |
|---|---|---|
| No vendor finance | $22.0M (40% of $55M) | 43.3% |
| With $7.9M vendor finance | $14.1M | ~58% |
| Vendor finance + token raise ($15M) | Equity need covered | Significant IRR uplift |

## Export Credit Agency (ECA) Support

If modules or equipment sourced from:

| Country | ECA | Instrument |
|---|---|---|
| China | Sinosure | Export credit insurance, buyer's credit |
| Germany | Euler Hermes / KfW IPEX | Export credit guarantee |
| South Korea | K-sure | Export credit insurance |
| Japan | NEXI | Trade insurance |
| USA | Ex-Im Bank | Direct loan, loan guarantee |

ECA support provides below-market financing for equipment procurement — typically 2-3% fixed rate, 10-15 year tenor.

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Vendor insolvency mid-project | Performance bonds, parent company guarantees |
| Equipment quality / warranty | Tier-1 bankability rating, independent engineer inspection |
