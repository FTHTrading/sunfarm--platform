# YIELDCO EXIT STRATEGY

## SunFarm PV 50 MW — Year 5 Drop-Down Valuation

---

## Concept

After reaching Commercial Operation Date (COD) and establishing 2-3 years of operating history, the stabilized asset can be transferred ("dropped down") into a YieldCo — a publicly or privately traded vehicle that distributes cash flow as dividends.

This provides the sponsor with:

1. Capital recycling (partially or fully exit sponsor equity)
2. Valuation uplift (development discount eliminated post-COD)
3. Continued management fees
4. Portfolio platform premium

## Valuation Methodology

### Comparable Transaction Multiples

| Metric | Multiple Range | SunFarm Value |
|---|---|---|
| EV / MW (installed) | $1.2M - $1.8M/MW | $60M - $90M |
| EV / EBITDA | 8x - 12x | $80M - $120M |
| P / Cash Available for Distribution (CAFD) | 10x - 14x | $70M - $100M |
| Discounted Cash Flow (8% discount) | — | $81.7M (NPV@8%) |

**Estimated exit valuation range**: $70M - $100M

Against $55M CAPEX and $22M sponsor equity, this implies:

- 1.27x - 1.82x project multiple on CAPEX
- 3.2x - 4.5x equity multiple on sponsor investment
- Before accounting for 5 years of pre-exit distributions

### Valuation by Year

| Exit Year | Remaining PPA Life | Est. Valuation | Sponsor Equity Multiple |
|---|---|---|---|
| Year 3 (earliest) | 22 years | $65-85M | 2.5-3.5x |
| Year 5 (target) | 20 years | $70-100M | 3.2-4.5x |
| Year 7 | 18 years | $65-90M | 3.0-4.0x |
| Year 10 | 15 years | $55-75M | 2.5-3.4x |

**Optimal exit window**: Year 5-7 (maximizes remaining contract life while demonstrating operating track record)

## Target Dividend Yield

| Scenario | Annual CAFD | Dividend Yield Target | Implied Valuation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Conservative | $6.0M | 7% | $85.7M |
| Base | $7.5M | 6% | $125.0M |
| Aggressive | $9.0M | 5.5% | $163.6M |

Note: CAFD = Cash Available for Distribution = EBITDA - Debt Service - CAPEX reserves

## Drop-Down Mechanics

### Phase 1: Asset Stabilization (Year 1-3)

- Achieve COD and begin commercial operations
- Establish 24+ months of operating performance data
- Debt service coverage track record
- Confirm PPA counterparty performance

### Phase 2: YieldCo Formation (Year 3-4)

- Establish SunFarm YieldCo as holding vehicle
- Select structure: LP/LLC (private) or C-Corp (public)
- Engage investment bank for valuation and structuring
- Prepare offering memorandum or registration statement

### Phase 3: Drop-Down Execution (Year 5)

- Transfer operating assets from HoldCo to YieldCo
- Sponsor retains GP / management interest (2/20 style or fixed management fee)
- Distribute LP units to investor base
- Establish quarterly dividend distribution

### Phase 4: Portfolio Growth (Year 5+)

- Drop additional projects into YieldCo (if pipeline develops)
- Build portfolio scale for institutional investor appeal
- Potential IPO of YieldCo if scale exceeds $200M AUM
