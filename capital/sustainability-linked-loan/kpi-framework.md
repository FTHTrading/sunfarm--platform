## KPI Definitions

### KPI 1: CO₂ Emissions Avoided

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| **Metric** | Annual tonnes of CO₂ avoided through grid displacement |
| **Baseline** | 63,072 tCO₂ (Year 1, based on 105,120 MWh x 0.6 tCO₂/MWh) |
| **Threshold** | ≥ 95% of baseline adjusted for degradation |
| **Stretch Target** | ≥ 100% of baseline (overperformance relative to degradation) |
| **Measurement** | Grid meter data x DR national grid emission factor |
| **Verification** | Independent engineer annual report |
| **Margin Impact** | -15 bps at threshold, -25 bps at stretch |

### KPI 2: BESS Utilization Rate

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| **Metric** | Annual average BESS capacity utilization |
| **Baseline** | 65% (conservative estimate for Year 1) |
| **Threshold** | ≥ 75% |
| **Stretch Target** | ≥ 85% |
| **Measurement** | BESS management system logs, cycle count data |
| **Verification** | BESS OEM annual performance report |
| **Margin Impact** | -10 bps at threshold, -15 bps at stretch |

### KPI 3: Curtailment Reduction

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| **Metric** | % of potential generation curtailed (lower is better) |
| **Baseline** | Industry average ~5-8% for DR solar |
| **Threshold** | ≤ 3% curtailment rate |
| **Stretch Target** | ≤ 1.5% curtailment rate |
| **Measurement** | SCADA data: potential vs. actual generation |
| **Verification** | Grid operator (ETED) confirmation + independent engineer |
| **Margin Impact** | -10 bps at threshold, -15 bps at stretch |

### KPI 4: Local Employment

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| **Metric** | % of operations workforce from Peravia Province |
| **Baseline** | 50% |
| **Threshold** | ≥ 70% local workforce |
| **Stretch Target** | ≥ 85% local workforce |
| **Measurement** | Payroll records, residency documentation |
| **Verification** | Annual HR report, community liaison confirmation |
| **Margin Impact** | -5 bps at threshold, -10 bps at stretch |

### KPI 5: Water Management

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| **Metric** | Annual water runoff management and soil erosion metrics |
| **Baseline** | Pre-construction hydrological baseline study |
| **Threshold** | Zero reportable soil erosion incidents |
| **Stretch Target** | Positive biodiversity impact (vegetation cover increase) |
| **Measurement** | Environmental monitoring reports |
| **Verification** | Environmental consultant annual assessment |
| **Margin Impact** | -5 bps at threshold, -10 bps at stretch |

## Margin Ratchet Summary

| KPIs Achieved | Margin Adjustment | Effective Rate |
|---|---|---|
| 0 KPIs | +0 bps | SOFR + 300 bps |
| 1-2 KPIs at threshold | -15 to -25 bps | SOFR + 275-285 bps |
| 3-4 KPIs at threshold | -30 to -40 bps | SOFR + 260-270 bps |
| All 5 at threshold | -45 bps | SOFR + 255 bps |
| All 5 at stretch | -75 bps | SOFR + 225 bps |

**Maximum annual benefit at $30M facility**: ~$225,000 in reduced interest expense.

## Target Lenders

| Institution | Type | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Banco Popular Dominicano** | Local commercial | Largest DR bank, sustainability mandate, local market knowledge |
| **BanReservas** | State-owned commercial | Government alignment, infrastructure lending mandate |
| **Scotiabank Caribbean** | International commercial | Caribbean renewable energy portfolio, ESG commitments |
| **Citi Sustainable Finance** | Global commercial | SLL structuring expertise, LatAm presence |
| **Santander Corporate Banking** | International commercial | Renewable energy lending team, LatAm focus |
| **BICE (Banco de Inversión y Crédito)** | Local development | DR development mandate |

## Reporting Obligations

| Report | Frequency | Recipient |
|---|---|---|
| KPI Performance Report | Annual | Lender syndicate, sustainability agent |
| Independent Verification | Annual | Lender syndicate |
| Remediation Plan (if KPI missed) | Within 60 days | Sustainability agent |
| ESG Incident Report | As needed | Lender syndicate |

---

## Step-Up Mechanism

If 3 or more KPIs are missed in any measurement year:

- Margin increases by +25 bps for the following year
- Remediation plan required within 60 days
- Two consecutive years of 3+ KPI misses triggers sustainability review

This ensures the instrument maintains integrity — the margin ratchet is bidirectional.
