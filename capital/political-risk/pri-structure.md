## PRI Coverage Types

| Coverage | Description | Relevance to SunFarm |
|---|---|---|
| **Expropriation** | Government seizure or creeping expropriation of assets | Concession revocation risk (low probability) |
| **Transfer Restriction** | Inability to convert or transfer currency | USD-denominated PPA mitigates but does not eliminate |
| **Breach of Contract** | Government entity fails to honor contractual obligations | PPA counterparty default (if government-backed utility) |
| **War & Civil Disturbance** | Physical damage or business interruption from political violence | Low probability in DR |
| **Non-Honoring of Sovereign Financial Obligation** | Government guarantee default | Relevant if CDEEE backstop is obtained |

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### MIGA Coverage (recommended base layer)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Coverage amount | $55,000,000 (full CAPEX) |
| Annual premium (estimated) | 0.50% = $275,000 |
| Spread reduction benefit | 100 bps on $33M debt = $330,000/yr |
| **Net annual benefit** | **$55,000/yr** |
| **20-year NPV of benefit (@ 8%)** | **~$540,000** |

Premium is economically justified — the spread reduction exceeds the PRI cost.

### MIGA + DFC Stacked Coverage

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| MIGA coverage | Expropriation + breach of contract |
| DFC coverage | Transfer restriction + war & civil disturbance |
| Combined annual premium | ~$385,000 |
| Combined spread reduction | 125 bps = $412,500/yr |
| **Net annual benefit** | **$27,500/yr** |

Stacking provides comprehensive coverage with marginal net benefit. Primary value is non-economic: lender comfort and broader investor access.

## DR Sovereign Risk Context

| Indicator | Value | Implication |
|---|---|---|
| Sovereign credit rating | BB- (S&P), Ba3 (Moody's) | Sub-investment grade, PRI valuable |
| Political stability index | Moderate | Democratic transitions, no recent instability |
| Rule of law index | Moderate | Judiciary independent but capacity constraints |
| Bilateral Investment Treaties | 14 active | Germany-DR BIT covers parent entity |
| ICSID membership | Yes | International arbitration available |
| Historical expropriation events | None in energy sector | Positive precedent |

## PRI Application Timeline

| Phase | MIGA | DFC | Private |
|---|---|---|---|
| Application submission | Month 1 | Month 1 | Month 1 |
| Preliminary assessment | Month 2-3 | Month 2-3 | Month 1-2 |
| Underwriting review | Month 3-5 | Month 3-5 | Month 2-3 |
| Board/committee approval | Month 5-7 | Month 5-6 | Month 3-4 |
| Contract execution | Month 7-8 | Month 6-7 | Month 4-5 |

**Recommendation**: Initiate MIGA and DFC applications concurrently with financial close process. Private PRI can be obtained faster but at higher premium and shorter tenor.

---

## Integration with Capital Stack

PRI coverage should be coordinated with:

1. **Senior debt** — Lender requirement for PRI as condition precedent
2. **Green bond** — Rating uplift from MIGA guarantee
3. **Token securities** — Investor comfort for cross-border revenue participation
4. **Carbon forward** — Counterparty comfort for long-term offtake
