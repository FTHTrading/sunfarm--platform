# Fideicomiso de Oferta Pública de Valores — Overview

> **Classification: CONFIDENTIAL — Capital Markets Structuring**

## What Is a Fideicomiso de Oferta Pública?

A **Fideicomiso de Oferta Pública de Valores** is a Dominican Republic trust structure that enables the securitization of assets or cash flows and their placement into the local securities market through the **Bolsa de Valores de la República Dominicana (BVRD)**.

This is the **DR-native equivalent of a capital markets wrapper** — a regulated vehicle that allows projects to issue fixed-income or participation securities to local institutional investors (pension funds, insurance companies, banks, family offices).

## Regulatory Framework

| Authority | Role |
|---|---|
| **SIMV** (Superintendencia del Mercado de Valores) | Securities regulator — approves trust issuances, green labeling |
| **BVRD** (Bolsa de Valores de la República Dominicana) | Exchange — listing and trading venue |
| **Fiduciary Provider** | Trust administrator — manages assets, distributions, reporting |

### Key Precedent: Larimar I

SIMV approved the **Fideicomiso de Oferta Pública de Valores Larimar I (No. 04-FP)** as the **first green fixed-income security** in the Dominican Republic.

**Source:** [SIMV — Larimar I Green Approval](https://simv.gob.do/superintendencia-del-mercado-de-valores-aprueba-primer-valor-verde-de-renta-fija-en-la-republica-dominicana-del-fideicomiso-de-oferta-publica-de-valores-larimar-i-no-04-fp/)

This precedent is directly relevant: it demonstrates that SIMV will approve green-labeled trust issuances backed by renewable energy assets.

```

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Energy SPV assigns specific cash flows** (PPA revenue, BESS revenue, or a blend) to the trust
2. **Fiduciary provider** administers the trust — receives cash, makes distributions, reports to SIMV
3. **Trust issues fixed-income or participation securities** — sold to investors through BVRD
4. **Investors receive** periodic distributions (coupon or dividend) from the ringfenced cash flows
5. **SIMV oversees** disclosure, reporting, and investor protection
