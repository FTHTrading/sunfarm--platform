# AGRICULTURE IMPACT FUNDING

## SunFarm PV 50 MW — LandCo Agricultural Revenue Layer

---

## Opportunity Summary

440.68 hectares of titled agricultural land in Baní, Peravia Province presents a dual-use opportunity: utility-scale solar generation with integrated agrivoltaic production. The agricultural layer provides incremental revenue, ESG narrative strength, and access to impact capital channels not available to conventional solar projects.

## Agricultural Revenue Streams

| Stream | Annual Revenue | Escalation | 25-Year Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| Agrivoltaic production (under-panel farming) | $500,000 | 2.5%/yr | ~$16.6M |
| Perimeter / non-array agriculture | $300,000 | 2.5%/yr | ~$10.0M |
| **Total agricultural revenue** | **$800,000** | | **~$26.6M** |

Crops suitable for under-panel agrivoltaic production in Peravia Province:

- Mango (shade-tolerant varieties)
- Passion fruit
- Herbs and medicinal plants
- Shade-grown coffee (experimental)
- Root vegetables (yuca, batata)

## Grant Blending Model

### Scenario: $2M Ag Impact Grant + $3M Concessional Ag Loan

| Component | Source | Amount | Terms |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ag infrastructure (irrigation, fencing) | Grant (IDB Lab) | $1,000,000 | Non-repayable |
| Agrivoltaic R&D (crop optimization) | Grant (USAID) | $500,000 | Non-repayable |
| Technical assistance | Grant (Root Capital) | $500,000 | Non-repayable |
| Working capital (seeds, inputs, labor) | Concessional loan (IFAD) | $2,000,000 | 2%, 10-year, 3-year grace |
| Equipment (harvesting, processing) | Concessional loan (Root Capital) | $1,000,000 | 4%, 7-year |

**Total ag investment**: $5,000,000 ($2M grant + $3M concessional debt)

### Impact on LandCo Returns

| Metric | Without Grant | With $2M Grant |
|---|---|---|
| Ag setup cost | $5,000,000 (fully funded by LandCo) | $3,000,000 (grants cover $2M) |
| Annual ag revenue | $800,000 | $800,000 |
| Ag-only payback | 6.3 years | 3.8 years |
| Land-only IRR | ~12% | ~18% |

## ESG Narrative Value

Agricultural integration provides:

1. **Job creation**: 50-80 permanent agricultural jobs in Peravia Province
2. **Food security**: Local food production alongside energy generation
3. **Community engagement**: Smallholder partnership programs
4. **Biodiversity**: Pollinator habitat, soil health improvement
5. **Water management**: Shade reduces evaporation, panels collect runoff

These narratives strengthen:

- IFC/IDB social performance assessment
- Green bond SPO (community benefit component)
- Sustainability-linked loan KPIs
- Political risk reduction (community support = political insulation)

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Activities |
|---|---|---|
| Crop selection & soil analysis | 3 months | Soil testing, crop trials, yield modeling |
| Infrastructure installation | 4-6 months | Irrigation, fencing, access roads |
| First planting cycle | 6-12 months | Seasonal crop establishment |
| Revenue generation | Month 12+ | First harvest and market sales |
| Scale-up | Year 2-3 | Expand to full agricultural capacity |
