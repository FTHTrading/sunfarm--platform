# SPO Terms & Provider Assessment

> **Classification: CONFIDENTIAL — Capital Markets Advisory**

## What Is a Second Party Opinion (SPO)?

A **Second Party Opinion** is an independent assessment by a qualified external firm that evaluates the green, social, or sustainability credentials of a bond, loan, or other financial instrument against recognized standards (ICMA GBP, TVRD, CBI, EU Taxonomy).

SPOs are **market standard** for green bond and green fideicomiso issuances. Without an SPO, institutional investors — particularly pension funds and ESG-mandated allocators — will not participate.

## Recommendation

| Issuance Type | Recommended SPO Provider | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **International Green Bond** | Sustainalytics | Widest recognition, gold standard |
| **DR Fideicomiso (TVRD-labeled)** | Local provider + TVRD assessment | Lower cost; SIMV-appropriate |
| **Dual (local + intl)** | Sustainalytics + Feller Rate | Covers both investor bases |

## Budget

| Item | Estimated Cost |
|---|---|
| SPO — International (Sustainalytics) | $35,000 |
| SPO — Local (Feller Rate or equivalent) | $15,000 |
| Annual Review (optional) | $10,000/yr |
| Green Framework drafting (counsel) | $15,000 |
| **Total (initial)** | **$50,000–$65,000** |

> Cost is immaterial relative to issuance size ($15–50M) and the capital access it unlocks.

*SPO engagement should be initiated 3–4 months before target issuance date. Documentation requirements are largely satisfied by existing repo content.*
