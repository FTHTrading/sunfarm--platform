# ICMA GREEN BOND PRINCIPLES — ALIGNMENT MATRIX

## SunFarm PV 50 MW Green Bond Framework

---

## Framework Reference

International Capital Market Association (ICMA) Green Bond Principles, June 2021, with June 2022 Appendix 1 updates.

---

## Core Component Alignment

### 1. Use of Proceeds

| Principle Requirement | SunFarm Alignment | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Proceeds must finance eligible green projects | 100% allocated to solar PV, BESS, and transmission infrastructure | Aligned |
| Clear environmental benefit | 63,000+ tCO₂ avoided annually, displacing fossil generation on DR grid | Aligned |
| Eligible categories defined | Renewable energy, energy storage, clean transportation (grid infrastructure) | Aligned |

**Eligible Green Project Categories (per ICMA taxonomy)**:

- Renewable Energy: Solar photovoltaic generation (50 MW AC)
- Energy Storage: Battery energy storage system (100 MWh LFP)
- Clean Transportation: Grid transmission infrastructure (138kV, 4.5 km)

---

### 2. Process for Project Evaluation and Selection

| Requirement | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Environmental sustainability objectives | CO₂ displacement, grid decarbonization, BESS grid stability |
| Process for determining eligibility | Technical committee review against ICMA categories |
| Exclusion criteria | No fossil fuel components, no deforestation, no involuntary resettlement |
| Environmental risk assessment | EIA approved (License 0379-20), Certificación de No Superposición |

---

### 3. Management of Proceeds

| Requirement | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Net proceeds tracking | Dedicated project account, segregated from general corporate funds |
| Temporary investment of unallocated proceeds | Short-term USD money market, sovereign bonds, or cash equivalents |
| Internal tracking process | Monthly reconciliation by project finance team |
| Periodic adjustment | Quarterly reallocation review |

**Account Structure**:

```
Green Bond Proceeds Account (Wells Fargo / Citi trustee)
├── Construction Disbursement Sub-Account
├── BESS Procurement Sub-Account
├── Transmission Sub-Account
├── Unallocated Proceeds (temporary investment)
└── Debt Service Reserve (6 months)
```

---

### 4. Reporting

| Requirement | Frequency | Content |
|---|---|---|
| Allocation reporting | Annual | Use of proceeds by category, % allocated |
| Impact reporting | Annual | MWh generated, tCO₂ avoided, BESS utilization |
| Independent verification | Annual | External auditor confirmation |

**Impact Metrics for Annual Reporting**:

| Metric | Unit | Expected Value |
|---|---|---|
| Annual generation | MWh | 105,120 (Year 1) |
| CO₂ avoided | tCO₂/yr | ~63,000 |
| Homes powered equivalent | Households | ~35,000 |
| BESS utilization rate | % | Target >85% |
| Grid stability events mitigated | Count | Tracked quarterly |
| Local employment (construction) | Jobs | 200-300 |
| Local employment (operations) | Jobs | 25-40 |

---

## Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI) — Certification Path

| CBI Requirement | SunFarm Status |
|---|---|
| Solar criterion eligible | Yes — utility-scale PV |
| Pre-issuance verification | Required — approved verifier engagement |
| Post-issuance verification | Annual — within 24 months of issuance |
| Nominated verifier | DNV, ERM, or Sustainalytics (to be selected) |

---

## Second Party Opinion (SPO) — Provider Selection

| Provider | Strengths | Estimated Timeline | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sustainalytics** (Morningstar) | Market leader, IFC-recognized | 4-6 weeks | $25-40K |
| **ISS ESG** | Strong European investor base | 4-6 weeks | $20-35K |
| **Vigeo Eiris** (Moody's) | Rating agency integration | 6-8 weeks | $30-45K |
| **CICERO** | Academic rigor, Nordic investors | 6-8 weeks | $25-40K |

**Recommendation**: Sustainalytics — broadest institutional recognition, IFC anchor investor preference.

## EU Taxonomy Alignment (Informational)

While this issuance targets USD markets under ICMA principles, EU Taxonomy alignment strengthens European investor appeal.

| Taxonomy Criterion | SunFarm Assessment |
|---|---|
| Substantial contribution to climate mitigation | Yes — renewable energy generation |
| Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) | EIA approved, no deforestation, water management plan |
| Minimum safeguards | Labor standards, anti-corruption (to be documented) |
| Technical screening criteria | Solar PV lifecycle emissions < 100 gCO₂/kWh — compliant |
