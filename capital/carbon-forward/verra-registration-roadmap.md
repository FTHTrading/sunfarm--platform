## Revenue Projections by Market

| Market Standard | Price/tCO₂ | Annual Revenue | 25-Year Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Verra VCS** | $15 | $945,000 | $29.6M |
| **Gold Standard** | $28 | $1,764,000 | $55.8M |
| **Compliance Market** | $50 | $3,150,000 | $98.0M |
| **Voluntary Premium** | $85 | $5,355,000 | $163.8M |

Note: 25-year totals include 3%/yr price escalation and 0.4%/yr generation degradation.

## Additionality Demonstration

### Investment Barrier

- Project CAPEX of $55M exceeds available sponsor equity
- Carbon revenue improves project bankability and attracts DFI financing
- Without carbon revenue, project IRR decreases by 200-400 bps
- Carbon revenue is material to financial close

### Common Practice Barrier

- Dominican Republic solar penetration below 5% of installed capacity
- No utility-scale solar with integrated BESS operating in Peravia Province
- Carbon credit registration not common practice for DR solar (fewer than 5 registered projects)

## Methodology Requirements (AMS-I.D)

| Requirement | SunFarm Compliance |
|---|---|
| Grid-connected renewable source | Yes — 50 MW solar PV, 138kV interconnection |
| Capacity ≤ 15 MW per unit (small-scale) | No — requires CDM equivalent or VCS large-scale |
| Baseline emissions | DR grid emission factor (combined margin) |
| Project emissions | Assumed zero (solar PV) |
| Monitoring requirements | Electricity meter at grid delivery point |
| Leakage | None applicable for grid-connected solar |

**Note**: If project exceeds AMS-I.D threshold, ACM0002 (Consolidated methodology for grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources) applies.

## Validation/Verification Bodies (VVBs)

| VVB | Accreditation | LatAm Experience | Estimated Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SCS Global Services** | Full VCS, GS | Extensive | $18-25K |
| **RINA** | Full VCS | Moderate | $15-22K |
| **TUV SUD** | Full VCS, CDM | Extensive | $20-28K |
| **Bureau Veritas** | Full VCS | Extensive | $18-25K |

**Recommendation**: SCS Global or TUV SUD — both have Caribbean/LatAm solar project experience.

## Parallel Registration Options

| Standard | Benefit | Complexity | Revenue Premium |
|---|---|---|---|
| Verra VCS only | Fastest, most liquid market | Low | Baseline |
| Verra VCS + CCB (Climate, Community, Biodiversity) | Premium pricing, impact narrative | Medium | +30-50% |
| Gold Standard | Higher pricing, EU buyer preference | Medium-High | +80-100% |
| Article 6 (Paris Agreement) | Sovereign credit trading | High | Variable |
