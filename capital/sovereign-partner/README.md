# SOVEREIGN & UTILITY MINORITY PARTNER

## SunFarm PV 50 MW — Strategic Stake Model

---

## Rationale

A 10-20% minority stake by a Dominican government entity or state-owned utility provides:

1. Political de-risking (sovereign alignment)
2. Off-taker alignment (utility partner = PPA certainty)
3. Regulatory facilitation (faster permitting, grid access)
4. Local capital markets credibility
5. PRI premium reduction (reduced expropriation risk)
