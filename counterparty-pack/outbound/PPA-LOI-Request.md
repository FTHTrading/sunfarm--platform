**Subject:** Request for Indicative Tariff — 50 MW Solar PV + 25 MW BESS · Baní, Dominican Republic

Dear [OFFTAKER_NAME],

We are advancing the **SunFarm** project — a 50 MW AC / 59.69 MWp DC bifacial solar PV plant with 25 MW / 100 MWh LFP battery storage located in Baní, Peravia Province, Dominican Republic.

The project is **fully entitled** with a 25-year definitive concession, environmental license, ETED grid no-objection (2024, revalidated 2025), and titled land.

We are seeking an **indicative letter of interest (LOI)** or **non-binding tariff indication** to support our financing process. We are not requesting a binding PPA at this stage — only enough commercial signal to advance lender engagement.

**What we are asking for:**

1. **Indicative tariff range** (¢/kWh or USD/MWh)
2. **Escalation mechanism** (fixed %, CPI-linked, or other)
3. **Tenor** (contract duration in years)
4. **Volume commitment** (full offtake, partial, or take-or-pay structure)
5. **Credit support outline** (sovereign guarantee, CDEEE backstop, or utility balance sheet)
6. **Next steps and timeline** to a binding term sheet

**Project Highlights:**

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Capacity | 50 MW AC / 59.69 MWp DC |
| BESS | 25 MW / 100 MWh (4-hr LFP) |
| Location | Baní, Peravia — ~4.5 km to 138 kV POI |
| Concession | CNE-CP-0012-2020 (25-year definitive) |
| Land | 440.68 ha, titled, no superposition |
| Target COD | [TARGET_COD — e.g., Q4 2027] |
| Modeled PPA Rate | $70/MWh, 1.5%/yr escalation (indicative) |

**Attached:**
- Project Summary (1-pager)
- Permit Stack (15 secured documents)
- Grid Interconnection Summary
- Environmental License Summary

An indicative LOI — even a one-page letter stating tariff range, tenor, and willingness to negotiate — is sufficient for our current financing stage.

We welcome a call or meeting at your earliest convenience.

## TARGET COUNTERPARTIES

| # | Entity | Type | Rationale |
|---|--------|------|-----------|
| 1 | **EDESUR** | Distribution utility | Southern zone operator — project's service area |
| 2 | **CDEEE** | State electric holding | Controls EDES companies; sovereign credit backstop |
| 3 | **EDENORTE** | Distribution utility | Northern zone — cross-selling; larger market |
| 4 | **Large C&I Off-taker** | Private corporate | Bilateral PPA alternative to utility offtake |
| 5 | **[International Trading House]** | Energy trader | Virtual PPA / financial settlement option |

---

## WHAT THIS PRODUCES

A single indicative LOI knocks out **Required Item #5 (PPA Term Sheet)** in draft form and:

- Unlocks lender engagement (DFI, commercial bank, green bond)
- Validates the $70/MWh assumption in all financial models
- Provides the Independent Engineer with a bankable revenue basis
- Enables the fideicomiso structuring (cash flow assignment)
