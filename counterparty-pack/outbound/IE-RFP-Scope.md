## 2. Scope of Services

### Phase 1: Interim Bankability Letter (2–3 weeks)

Deliver a preliminary technical opinion covering:

| Item | Scope |
|------|-------|
| **Permit Review** | Review 15 secured permits/licenses for completeness and validity |
| **Resource Preliminary** | Assess available satellite irradiance data (GHI, DNI, TMY) |
| **Technology Review** | Confirm appropriateness of bifacial 760W module + LFP BESS selection |
| **Layout Review** | Review existing Jairo Peña layouts (50/100/140 MW) for constructability |
| **Grid Review** | Assess ETED no-objection + revalidation for interconnection readiness |
| **Gap Identification** | List all outstanding items required for full bankability |
| **Risk Assessment** | Preliminary risk register (technical, regulatory, environmental) |
| **Interim Opinion** | Letter stating: "Subject to [gap list], project is technically viable for financing" |

**Deliverable:** Interim Bankability Letter (PDF, 5–10 pages)

### Phase 2: Full Technical Due Diligence (3–6 months, parallel)

| Work Package | Scope |
|-------------|-------|
| **Resource Assessment** | Commission or validate on-site irradiation campaign; produce P50/P75/P90 yield estimates |
| **Energy Yield Model** | Independent PVsyst or equivalent model with site-specific inputs |
| **Technology Assessment** | Module, inverter, BESS, BOS review and recommendation |
| **Layout Optimization** | Review/optimize plant layout for actual site conditions |
| **Civil/Geotech Review** | Review geotechnical report (once obtained) for foundation suitability |
| **Grid Impact Review** | Review grid impact study (once obtained) for interconnection adequacy |
| **Environmental Review** | Confirm EIA/license alignment with actual construction scope |
| **Construction Feasibility** | Assess EPC schedule, logistics, labor market, supply chain |
| **Financial Model Audit** | Review project financial model assumptions against technical findings |
| **Final Bankability Report** | Comprehensive report suitable for lender/investor due diligence |

**Deliverable:** Final Bankability Report (PDF, 50–100 pages + appendices)

## 3. Resource Validation Approach

We request the IE to recommend:

| Question | What We Need |
|----------|-------------|
| **Satellite data** | Which TMY datasets to use (SolarGIS, Meteonorm, NASA POWER) for interim assessment? |
| **On-site campaign** | Specification for ground-based measurement station (pyranometer class, duration, mounting) |
| **Campaign duration** | Minimum months required for bankable P50/P90 (typically 12, but can an interim 6-month dataset suffice with satellite correlation?) |
| **Procurement** | Recommended equipment suppliers for the measurement campaign |
| **Correlation method** | MCP or other site-adaptation methodology |
