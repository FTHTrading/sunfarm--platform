## 1. Registry Eligibility Analysis

### 1.1 Verra (Verified Carbon Standard — VCS)

| Criterion | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Eligible?** | **YES — with conditions** |
| Applicable Methodology | **ACM0002** — Consolidated baseline methodology for grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources (v20.0+) |
| Alternative | **AMS-I.D** — Grid-connected renewable electricity generation (simplified, for projects <15 MW; SunFarm exceeds threshold → use ACM0002) |
| DR Grid Emission Factor | **0.632 tCO₂/MWh** (2023 SENI data; combined margin method per UNFCCC Tool 07) |
| Additionality | Must demonstrate under **VCS Standard v4.5** — Investment barrier analysis + common practice analysis. DR solar at 50 MW scale has limited precedent, which supports additionality |
| Double Counting Risk | **Moderate** — DR ratified Paris Agreement. Article 6 corresponding adjustments required if credits sold internationally. NDC ambition level review needed |
| Host Country Authorization | DR Ministry of Environment & Natural Resources must issue Letter of Authorization (LoA) under Article 6.2 for international transfer. **Process exists but not yet streamlined** |

### 1.2 Gold Standard

| Criterion | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Eligible?** | **YES** |
| Methodology | **RE methodology for grid-connected projects** |
| Advantage | Higher price premium ($2–$8/tCO₂e above VCS for GS-labeled credits) |
| Disadvantage | Stakeholder consultation requirements more stringent; longer registration timeline |
| SDG Assessment | Required — SunFarm qualifies for SDG 7 (Clean Energy), SDG 8 (Jobs), SDG 13 (Climate), SDG 15 (Land) |
| Recommendation | Consider if price premium justifies 2–3 month longer timeline |

### 1.3 I-REC Standard

| Criterion | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Eligible?** | **YES — separate instrument** |
| Note | I-RECs are **energy attribute certificates**, NOT carbon credits. Different market, different buyers. Can be issued IN ADDITION to carbon credits (no double counting between I-RECs and VCRs if properly structured) |
| Value | $1–$5/MWh |
| Volume | ~100,000 MWh/year |
| Use | Corporate Scope 2 accounting, RE100 compliance |

### 1.4 Article 6 Mechanisms

| Criterion | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Article 6.2 | **Bilateral ITMOs** — DR can authorize internationally transferred mitigation outcomes. Pathway exists but DR has limited bilateral agreements signed as of early 2026 |
| Article 6.4 | **Successor to CDM** — Supervisory Body established; methodologies under development. Grid solar not yet fully operationalized under Art 6.4 |
| Recommendation | **Do not rely on Article 6 for near-term (90-day) pre-sale.** Use voluntary market (VCS/GS) as primary path. Monitor Article 6 as upside |

### 1.5 Baseline Emission Factor

| Source | Grid EF (tCO₂/MWh) | Year | Method |
|---|---|---|---|
| SENI / OC Published Data | 0.632 | 2023 | Combined Margin |
| UNFCCC CDM Database (DR) | 0.617 | 2022 | Build + Operating Margin |
| IFI Harmonized (World Bank) | 0.64 | 2023 | Estimate |

**Recommended value for modeling:** 0.63 tCO₂/MWh (conservative)

---

## 2. Estimated Annual Credit Volume

### 2.1 Generation Assumptions

| Parameter | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Installed DC Capacity | 59.69 MWp | Project spec |
| Performance Ratio | 82% | Bifacial, hot climate conservative |
| Specific Yield | 1,550–1,680 kWh/kWp/yr | Solargis, NSRDB for Baní |
| Annual Generation (base) | **92,500–100,300 MWh** | Yield estimate |
| Annual Generation (modeled) | **95,000 MWh** | Mid-range |

### 2.2 Credit Calculation

| Scenario | Annual Gen (MWh) | Grid EF (tCO₂/MWh) | Annual Credits (tCO₂e) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Conservative | 90,000 | 0.60 | **54,000** |
| Base | 95,000 | 0.63 | **59,850** |
| Optimistic | 100,000 | 0.65 | **65,000** |

**Working assumption: ~60,000 tCO₂e/year**

## 3. Time-to-Issuance Timeline

### 3.1 Fastest Path — Verra VCS

| Phase | Activity | Duration | Running Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Month 1** | Engage validation/verification body (VVB), prepare Project Design Document (PDD) | 4 weeks | Week 4 |
| **Month 2–3** | PDD development, stakeholder consultation, VVB desk review | 8 weeks | Week 12 |
| **Month 3–4** | Verra listing review + publication of PDD for public comment (30 days) | 4–6 weeks | Week 16–18 |
| **Month 4–5** | VVB validation audit (desk + site visit) | 4 weeks | Week 20–22 |
| **Month 5–6** | Validation report + Verra registration review | 4–6 weeks | Week 24–28 |
| **Registration** | **Project registered** | — | **Month 6–7** |
| **Month 12+** | First monitoring period ends → verification → credit issuance | 6–12 months post-registration | **Month 12–18** |

**First credit issuance: 12–18 months from initiation** (under normal VCS timeline)

### 3.2 Accelerated Path — Forward Sale Before Issuance

Critical insight: **Credits do NOT need to be issued to sell them forward.** 

Forward purchase agreements can be executed at:
- **PDD completion stage** (Month 3–4) — earliest practical point
- **Validation stage** (Month 5–6) — most common trigger
- **Registration stage** (Month 6–7) — full certainty except verification

**Realistic forward contract signing: Month 3–5 from initiation**

---

## 4. Forward Sale Feasibility

### 4.1 Can Credits Be Sold Before Issuance?

**YES — this is standard market practice.**

Forward purchase agreements (Emission Reduction Purchase Agreements — ERPAs) are the primary instrument. The voluntary carbon market has well-established forward structures.

### 4.2 Legal Structures

| Structure | Description | Typical Use |
|---|---|---|
| **ERPA (Forward)** | Binding agreement to deliver specified quantity of credits at future date | Most common — IETA template widely used |
| **Offtake Agreement** | Right of first refusal or commitment to purchase at pre-agreed price | Used by corporates |
| **Option Agreement** | Buyer pays premium for right (not obligation) to purchase | Less common for renewables |
| **Prepaid Forward** | Buyer pays upfront for future delivery — closest to "advance" | **Target structure for SunFarm** |

### 4.3 Upfront Payment Range

| Forward Type | Typical Upfront | Conditions |
|---|---|---|
| Standard ERPA | **0–10%** at signing, balance on delivery | Most conservative |
| Prepaid Forward | **15–30%** at signing | Requires strong counterparty + delivery guarantee |
| Development-Stage Forward | **10–20%** at validation milestone | Milestone-linked payments |
| Portfolio Forward | **20–40%** | Only for diversified portfolios (not single-project) |

**Realistic for SunFarm: 10–20% upfront, with milestone payments at registration and issuance**

### 4.4 Documentation Required for Forward Contract

| # | Document | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Project Design Document (PDD) or draft | ❌ Not started |
| 2 | Feasibility study / engineering design | ✅ Available (layouts, LARED summary) |
| 3 | Environmental license | ✅ License 0379-20 |
| 4 | Grid interconnection confirmation | ✅ ETED No-Objection |
| 5 | Land title / concession | ✅ Title secured |
| 6 | Emission reduction estimate | ⚠️ This document provides preliminary estimate |
| 7 | Legal opinion on host country authorization | ❌ Must commission |
| 8 | VVB engagement letter | ❌ Must procure |
| 9 | Registry account | ❌ Must open with Verra |
| 10 | Corporate KYC / AML documentation | ✅ Entity registered |

### 4.5 Market-Standard Protections

| Protection | Description |
|---|---|
| **Make-Whole** | Seller guarantees replacement credits if shortfall |
| **Delivery Guarantee** | Parent guarantee or letter of credit |
| **Price Adjustment** | Floor + ceiling mechanisms |
| **Force Majeure** | Defined events (regulatory change, natural disaster) |
| **Replacement Risk** | Buyer can source alternatives at seller's cost |
| **Volume Tolerance** | Typically ±10–15% variance allowed |

## 6. Financial Model — 10-Year Forward Value

### 6.1 Annual Revenue Scenarios

| Scenario | Annual Credits | Price/tCO₂e | Annual Revenue | 10-Year Nominal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Conservative | 54,000 | $4 | $216,000 | $2,160,000 |
| Base | 60,000 | $6 | $360,000 | $3,600,000 |
| Optimistic | 65,000 | $10 | $650,000 | $6,500,000 |

### 6.2 Upfront Liquidity from Forward Sale

| Scenario | 10-Year Value | Upfront % | **Upfront Advance** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Conservative | $2.16M | 15% | **$324,000** |
| Base | $3.60M | 20% | **$720,000** |
| Optimistic | $6.50M | 25% | **$1,625,000** |
| Aggressive | $6.50M | 30% | **$1,950,000** |

### 6.3 Realistic Assessment

**Can carbon pre-sale unlock $2M+ in upfront liquidity within 90 days?**

| Component | Assessment |
|---|---|
| $2M+ upfront from carbon alone | **UNLIKELY within 90 days** — requires registration-stage forward, which takes 6–7 months |
| $700K–$1M upfront in 90 days | **POSSIBLE** — if pre-registration forward at development stage with 15–20% advance |
| $2M+ with stacked instruments | **YES** — Carbon forward ($700K–$1M) + I-REC forward ($200K–$400K) + PPA prepayment ($1M+) = $2M+ achievable |
| 90-day target | Aggressive but feasible for broker engagement + forward term sheet. Full contract signing more likely at 120–150 days |

## 7. Risk Analysis

### 7.1 Registry Risk

| Risk | Level | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| VCS methodology eligibility | **LOW** | ACM0002 is well-established for grid solar |
| Additionality challenge | **LOW-MEDIUM** | 50 MW in DR has limited precedent; can argue financial + barrier additionality |
| Registration delay | **MEDIUM** | Verra backlog can add 2–4 months. GS similar |

### 7.2 Regulatory Risk — Dominican Republic

| Risk | Level | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Carbon market regulation | **LOW** | No DR-specific carbon tax or compliance market that would create conflict |
| NDC accounting | **MEDIUM** | DR NDC 27% emission reduction by 2030 (conditional). Carbon credit exports could affect NDC compliance if not managed via corresponding adjustment |
| Host country authorization | **MEDIUM** | DR Ministry of Environment process exists but not heavily tested for large solar. Legal opinion required |
| Retroactive policy | **LOW** | No indication of hostile policy toward VCM in DR |

### 7.3 Article 6 Double Counting Risk

| Risk | Level | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Double counting | **MEDIUM-HIGH** | If DR claims emission reductions for NDC AND credits are sold internationally, double counting occurs. Requires corresponding adjustment under Article 6.2 |
| Mitigation | Secure host country authorization letter explicitly authorizing international transfer. OR sell to DR domestic buyers (no corresponding adjustment needed) |
| Market impact | Some buyers now require Article 6 compliance. Non-compliance may limit buyer pool |

### 7.4 Price & Market Risk

| Risk | Level | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Price decline | **MEDIUM** | Renewable energy credits trade at lower end of VCM. Prices have compressed since 2023 peak. Structural oversupply in some categories |
| Demand risk | **LOW-MEDIUM** | Corporate net-zero commitments sustaining demand. CORSIA Phase 2 (2027) creates new demand pool |
| Integrity risk | **MEDIUM** | VCM integrity scrutiny (IC-VCM Core Carbon Principles) may affect credit quality perception. Ensure alignment with CCP criteria |

### 7.5 Delivery / Project Risk

| Risk | Level | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Construction delay | **MEDIUM** | No EPC contract yet. Forward buyer may require construction milestones |
| Generation shortfall | **LOW** | Bifacial PV in DR has strong irradiation. Performance risk manageable |
| Reversal risk | **N/A** | Not applicable for renewable energy credits (no permanence risk) |

## 10. Key Technical Studies Gating Credit Valuation

| Study | Purpose | Status | Impact on Valuation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Independent Energy Yield Assessment | Validates MWh/year → directly determines credit volume | ❌ Not done — IE RFP created | **HIGH** — buyers require third-party yield |
| Grid Emission Factor Study | Confirms baseline → determines tCO₂/MWh | ⚠️ Using published data | MEDIUM — published factors are standard |
| Additionality Analysis | Proves project wouldn't happen without carbon finance | ❌ Must develop in PDD | HIGH — registration depends on this |
| Financial Model (IRR with/without carbon) | Additionality evidence — investment barrier test | ⚠️ Model exists but needs carbon scenario | HIGH — core additionality argument |

---

## 11. Verdict & Recommendations

### Primary Finding

**Carbon pre-sale is a viable but not immediate liquidity source.** It is a 3–6 month path to first cash, not a 30-day solution. However, the engagement process should start NOW because:

1. **Forward LOI can be secured in 30–60 days** (non-binding, demonstrates institutional backing)
2. **First upfront payment possible at Month 3–5** when PDD completed and forward buyer commits
3. **Stacked with I-RECs and PPA prepayment, $2M+ target is achievable**

### Recommended Strategy

| Priority | Action | Target |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | Open Verra account + engage carbon advisory firm | Week 1 |
| **2** | Send project summary to 3–5 forward brokers | Week 2 |
| **3** | Commission legal opinion on DR host country authorization | Week 1–2 |
| **4** | Secure forward sale LOI / term sheet | Month 2–3 |
| **5** | Complete PDD, trigger upfront payment | Month 3–5 |
| **6** | Register project, trigger second milestone payment | Month 6–8 |

### What NOT To Do

- ❌ Do not wait for credit issuance to engage buyers (forward market exists)
- ❌ Do not rely on carbon alone for $2M+ in 90 days (stacking required)
- ❌ Do not ignore Article 6 / corresponding adjustment risk (get legal opinion early)
- ❌ Do not use Gold Standard if speed is priority (VCS is faster for registration)
- ❌ Do not skip VVB engagement (forward buyers want validation pathway letter)
