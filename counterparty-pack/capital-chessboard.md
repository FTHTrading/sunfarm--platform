## Strategic Premise

Early stage capital does NOT require equity dilution. It can come from:

- Forward revenue monetization
- Asset presales & leaseback
- Equipment vendor financing
- Structured deposits & advances
- Collateral monetization
- Development rights transfer
- Platform licensing

This document maps **24 mechanisms** across 7 categories, ranks them by execution speed, and defines the optimal hybrid stack.
