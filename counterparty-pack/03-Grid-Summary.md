## Documents Obtained

### 1. ETED No-Objection Letter (February 2024)

ETED issued a formal no-objection to the interconnection of the SunFarm project at the designated 138 kV bus. This letter confirms that:

- The proposed interconnection point has available capacity
- ETED has no technical objection to the connection
- The project may proceed with detailed interconnection studies

### 2. ETED Technical Revalidation (May 2025)

ETED issued a technical revalidation report 15 months after the original no-objection, confirming that:

- The interconnection point remains valid
- No competing projects have claimed the capacity
- The technical parameters remain within acceptable limits
- The revalidation covers the expanded scope including BESS

## What's Still Required

| Item | Purpose | Dependency |
|------|---------|------------|
| **Updated Interconnection Agreement** | Formal bilateral contract between ETED and SPV for grid access | Requires final layout + protection coordination study |
| **Grid Impact Study Finalization** | Full system impact assessment (SIA) for 50 MW PV + 25 MW BESS injection | ETED or independent consultant |

## Key Context for Counterparties

- The 138 kV bus at Peravia is a strong, high-capacity interconnection point (co-located with existing solar assets)
- No-objection + revalidation = **two formal ETED confirmations** over 15-month period
- 4.5 km transmission distance is short — reduces interconnection CAPEX
- Double-circuit 138 kV provides redundancy
- BESS at 25 MW improves grid operator acceptance (dispatchability, frequency response)
