## Key Context for Counterparties

- Environmental license obtained **before** concession contract was signed — proactive compliance
- License covers the 50 MW PV scope that is the **current bidding basis**
- BESS environmental clearance is a **fast-track** category in DR (energy storage classified as grid asset, not generation)
- No known environmental sensitivities on site (agricultural land, not protected habitat)
- Drone survey (Sep 2025, 302 photos) provides current-state baseline for any modification filing
