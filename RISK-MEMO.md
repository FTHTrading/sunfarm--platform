# RISK MEMO — SunFarm PV 50 MW

## Classification: CONFIDENTIAL — For Qualified Investors and Diligence Counsel

---

## 1. Regulatory Risk

**Description**: Government policy changes, concession modification, or retroactive regulatory action that impairs project economics.

**Specific Exposures**:
- CNE Resolution CNE-CP-0012-2020 defines concession terms — amendment requires CNE board action
- Ley 57-07 renewable incentives (10-year tax exemption) could be modified by legislative action
- Decreto 517-25 (BESS mandate) imposes additional CAPEX requirements
- Grid access rules may tighten as renewable penetration increases

**Probability**: Low-Medium

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation**:
1. Definitive concession (not provisional) — harder to revoke than provisional
2. Construction-start obligation creates vested rights upon commencement
3. Bilateral investment treaty protections (Germany-DR BIT via parent)
4. Political risk insurance via DFC or MIGA
5. Active engagement with CNE and industry association
6. Concession contract specifies arbitration for disputes

---

## 2. PPA Counterparty Risk

**Description**: Off-taker default, renegotiation, or inability to honor PPA pricing terms.

**Specific Exposures**:
- DR electricity market has experienced tariff disputes
- Utility financial health varies with commodity prices and FX
- Government-mandated tariff caps could override PPA terms

**Probability**: Low-Medium

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation**:
1. Target creditworthy off-taker (EDES with government backstop)
2. Merchant tail option — sell excess on spot market
3. Corporate PPA diversification (mining, FTZ tenants)
4. Revenue stacking reduces PPA dependency (carbon, BESS, ag = ~35% of revenue)
5. PPA assignment to senior lender provides enforcement mechanism
6. Escrow account for 3-month receivables

---

## 3. Transmission / Grid Capacity Risk

**Description**: Grid congestion, curtailment, or inability to deliver power at POI.

**Specific Exposures**:
- 138kV Peravia Solar I & II substation capacity limits
- ETED network congestion as more solar enters Southern zone
- 4.5 km transmission line construction and permitting risk

**Probability**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium-High

**Mitigation**:
1. ETED No-Objection obtained Feb 2024, revalidated May 2025
2. 25 MW / 100 MWh BESS mitigates curtailment (store and shift)
3. Double-circuit 138kV line provides N-1 redundancy
4. Alternative POI identified (Calabaza I) as fallback
5. Curtailment mitigation modeled in BESS revenue engine (~$137K/yr)
6. BESS duration (4 hours) sufficient to shift full curtailment events

---

## 4. BESS Price / Performance Volatility

**Description**: Battery degradation exceeding projections, warranty failures, or ancillary service market price collapse.

**Specific Exposures**:
- LFP degradation assumed at 2%/yr — actual may vary
- Ancillary service markets in DR are immature
- BESS CAPEX $250/kWh — replacement cost at Year 15
- Round-trip efficiency (88%) may decline with age

**Probability**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation**:
1. LFP chemistry (not NMC) — longer cycle life, no thermal runaway
2. Augmentation reserve modeled at 30% of BESS CAPEX at Year 15
3. Conservative 2%/yr degradation (LFP typically 1.5%)
4. O&M for BESS at $8/kW/yr (market standard)
5. Multi-stream revenue (5 sources) — no single stream dependency
6. CAPEX payback modeled at Year 5-7 even under conservative assumptions

---

## 5. Carbon Market Volatility

**Description**: Carbon credit price collapse, market fragmentation, or regulatory changes eliminating credit demand.

**Specific Exposures**:
- Voluntary carbon market has experienced credibility challenges
- DR does not have a mandatory cap-and-trade system
- Verra/Gold Standard verification costs are fixed regardless of price
- Forward sale counterparty risk

**Probability**: Medium

**Impact**: Low-Medium (carbon = ~8% of total revenue)

**Mitigation**:
1. Carbon revenue is incremental — project is viable without it
2. Multi-standard strategy (Verra VCS as base, Gold Standard as premium)
3. Forward sale 3-5 year vintages to lock in floor pricing
4. Corporate buyer demand growing (Microsoft, Google, Amazon commitments)
5. Article 6 of Paris Agreement may create sovereign demand
6. Budget conservatively at $15/tCO₂ (current market: $20-50)

---

## 6. Environmental / Permitting Modification Risk

**Description**: Environmental license conditions changed, new species discovery, or community opposition requiring project redesign.

**Specific Exposures**:
- Environmental License 0379-20 granted — but subject to compliance monitoring
- Construction on 440 ha may encounter undocumented cultural or ecological sites
- Community relations in Baní region

**Probability**: Low

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation**:
1. Environmental License 0379-20 already granted and active
2. Site is agricultural/semi-arid land — low ecological sensitivity
3. Agrivoltaic design (agricultural co-use) supports community benefit
4. Environmental monitoring program as condition of license
5. Community benefit sharing (employment, ag leases, local procurement)
6. No protected areas or critical habitat identified in EIA

---

## 7. Construction Risk

**Description**: Cost overrun, schedule delay, contractor default, or supply chain disruption.

**Specific Exposures**:
- Construction start deadline: 6 months from contract signing
- Construction completion: 24 months from start
- Module supply chain (bifacial 760W) — limited manufacturers
- Hurricane season (June-November) disruption
- Skilled labor availability in Peravia province

**Probability**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium-High

**Mitigation**:
1. Fixed-price EPC contract with liquidated damages
2. EPC contractor performance bond / letter of credit ($2M)
3. Insurance: Builder's all-risk, delay in start-up
4. Module procurement with 6-month lead on EPC
5. Phased construction to reduce weather exposure
6. Contingency: 5% of CAPEX ($2.75M) in budget
7. Multiple EPC bidders (not sole-source)

---

## 8. Foreign Exchange Risk

**Description**: RD$/USD exchange rate movement impacting costs denominated in pesos while revenue may be USD-indexed.

**Specific Exposures**:
- Land costs, local labor, legal fees in RD$
- PPA likely denominated in USD or USD-indexed RD$
- Current rate: ~RD$62/USD
- DOP has depreciated ~3%/yr historically

**Probability**: Medium

**Impact**: Low-Medium

**Mitigation**:
1. Revenue denominated or indexed in USD (PPA, carbon, BESS)
2. Major CAPEX (modules, BESS) priced in USD
3. Peso-denominated costs are minority (~15% of total CAPEX)
4. Natural hedge: peso depreciation benefits USD-revenue project
5. FX reserve in operating account
6. DOP depreciation trend is gradual and predictable

---

## 9. Technology / Degradation Risk

**Description**: Module degradation exceeding 0.4%/yr assumption, inverter failures, or technology obsolescence.

**Probability**: Low

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation**:
1. Bifacial modules are proven technology (Tier 1 manufacturers)
2. 0.4%/yr degradation is conservative (typical: 0.3%)
3. 25-year manufacturer performance warranty (80% at Year 25)
4. Inverter replacement CAPEX modeled at Year 12
5. Monitoring system with real-time performance tracking
6. O&M contractor with availability guarantees

---

## 10. Tokenization / Securities Risk

**Description**: SEC enforcement action, token reclassification, or investor litigation regarding token structure.

**Probability**: Low-Medium

**Impact**: Medium-High

**Mitigation**:
1. Reg D 506(c) — established exemption framework
2. Accredited investors only — reduced regulatory exposure
3. Revenue participation (not equity) — reduces Howey risk
4. Token SPV structurally isolated from project assets
5. Qualified securities counsel review of all documents
6. Annual compliance review and reporting
7. No public trading — restricted transfer
8. Lock-up period (12 months) signals long-term alignment
