## 7. Total Basis Analysis

| Component | Amount | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Acquisition Price** | $35,000,000 | Full-asset purchase |
| **CAPEX (Construction)** | $55,000,000 | EPC + BESS + transmission |
| **Total Project Basis** | $90,000,000 | Acquisition + construction |
| **Transaction Costs** | ~$2,000,000 | Legal, advisory, transfer taxes |
| **All-In Basis** | ~$92,000,000 | Total deployed capital |

### 7.1 IRR Sensitivity to Total Basis

| Total Basis | Levered IRR (Base) | Min DSCR | Equity Multiple | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| $55M (CAPEX only) | 43.3% | 3.90x | 11.37x | ✅ Baseline |
| $75M ($20M + $55M) | ~28% | 3.20x | 6.5x | ✅ Acceptable |
| $90M ($35M + $55M) | ~18-22% | 2.50x | 4.0x | ⚠️ Floor target |
| $100M ($45M + $55M) | ~14% | 2.00x | 3.0x | ❌ Overpriced |

> **CRITICAL**: If $90M total basis drives IRR below 18%, the acquisition is overpriced. The acquisition-impact model (`models/acquisition-impact.js`) demonstrates this instantly across all D/E scenarios.
