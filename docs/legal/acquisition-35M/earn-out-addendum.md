| Performance Ratio ≥ 82% | $250,000 | Exceeds 80% PR threshold |
| Carbon credits registered | $250,000 | UNFCCC or Gold Standard registration |

**Maximum Upward Adjustment**: $1,500,000

1. **Rep & Warranty Claims**: Indemnification for breaches discovered post-closing
2. **Earn-Out Adjustments**: Downward adjustment amounts are first applied against escrow
3. **Environmental**: Any remediation costs arising from pre-closing conditions
4. **Tax**: Pre-closing tax assessments by DGII

### 5.2 Escrow Release Schedule

| Trigger | Amount Released | Timing |
|---|---|---|
| COD + 6 months (no claims) | $1,750,000 (50%) | 6 months post-COD |
| COD + 12 months (no claims) | $1,750,000 (50%) | 12 months post-COD |
| Disputed amounts | Held pending resolution | Until arbitration/settlement |
