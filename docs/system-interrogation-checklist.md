# SUNFARM BANÍ — FULL SYSTEM INTERROGATION

## VS Code Master Question Set & Shovel-Ready Reality Check

> **Purpose**: Pressure-test every claim, every number, every assumption before the banks do.
> Infrastructure does not stall because of lack of documents. It stalls because of cash alignment.
>
> This is not a checklist. This is a lender-grade interrogation protocol.

That is how institutional underwriting thinks.

---

# PART B — VS CODE QUESTION PACK: "SHOVEL-READY REALITY CHECK"

> 34 executable prompts. Feed each to Copilot / AI agents one by one.
> Force the system to produce every missing answer, generate missing docs, and mark **true shovel-ready** vs "looks shovel-ready."

---

### 0. FORCE A MASTER MAP

1. **"Scan the entire repo and produce a single master 'Project Truth Map': every claim in docs/os.html and docs/index.html with its source file, and flag any claim that lacks a primary source PDF."**

2. **"Build a `data-room/document-index.json` that includes: doc_name, category, required(Y/N), present(Y/N), file_path, source_type(primary/scanned/derived), last_updated, and 'blocking_item' flag."**

3. **"List the top 15 'committee questions' that would stop a lender from underwriting this if unanswered."**

---

### 1. LAND & TITLE (kill-switch category)

4. **"Confirm land is 'free and clear': identify liens, encumbrances, easements, usufruct, boundary disputes, taxes in arrears. If unknown, generate a due diligence request list (DR counsel + title insurer)."**

5. **"Reconcile land area differences: survey vs appraisal vs concession area. Produce an 'Area Reconciliation Memo' and a table of exactly which hectares are leased to the EnergySPV."**

6. **"Generate a title insurance readiness checklist for DR and the exact supporting docs needed to issue a policy."**

---

### 2. CONCESSION + REGULATORY (permits ≠ bankability)

7. **"Extract every obligation from the 2023 definitive concession contract: milestones, penalties, reporting duties, COD deadlines, revocation triggers. Summarize as a covenant table."**

8. **"Confirm the concession holder entity matches the SPV and that assignment/transfer is permitted. Draft the consent/assignment package if needed."**

9. **"Create a 'Regulatory Conditions Precedent' list for Financial Close and NTP."**

---

### 3. GRID / ETED INTERCONNECTION (most hidden delays live here)

10. **"Do we have an Interconnection Agreement or only a No-Objection? If missing, draft the gap plan and identify what ETED requires next."**

11. **"Summarize POI specs: voltage, bay requirements, protection scheme, SCADA/telemetry, metering. Output a one-page 'Grid Interface Requirements' sheet."**

12. **"Generate a schedule risk memo: long-lead grid items (transformers, breakers, CT/PT, switchgear) and procurement timelines."**

---

### 4. EPC + CONSTRUCTION (this is what makes it 'shovel-ready')

13. **"Do we have a bankable EPC contract (FIDIC-style) with LDs, performance guarantees, warranties, and security? If not, generate the exact EPC term sheet and draft EPC skeleton."**

14. **"Create an 'Owner's Engineer Scope' and deliverable list (IFC-ready)."**

15. **"Generate a construction schedule: NTP → COD with critical path, procurement lead times, and required site prep."**

16. **"Create a CAPEX basis book: line-item budget, contingencies, escalation, and tax incentives effect (Ley 57-07)."**

---

### 5. REVENUE (PPA is king)

17. **"Do we have a signed PPA? If not, generate the PPA procurement strategy: target off-takers, pricing bands, security package, and timeline."**

18. **"Model PPA downside: what's the minimum tariff needed for DSCR ≥ 1.25 under 6 scenarios?"**

19. **"Generate the 'Bank Case' and 'Base Case' model assumptions memo and explain differences."**

---

### 6. BESS (mandatory can be leverage, but only if real)

20. **"Confirm BESS regulatory requirement source and what compliance proof is needed (certificates, fire code, interconnection addendum)."**

21. **"Produce a BESS revenue verification memo: which streams are realistic in DR market, what counterparties exist, and what evidence is needed."**

22. **"Draft a BESS supply + LTSA (long-term service agreement) term sheet with warranty and performance guarantees."**

---

### 7. ENVIRONMENTAL & SOCIAL (DFIs care, and delays happen here)

23. **"Extract every condition from Environmental License 0379-20 and build an 'Environmental Compliance Tracker' with deadlines and evidence artifacts."**

24. **"Generate an ESMS (Environmental & Social Management System) outline aligned to IFC Performance Standards."**

25. **"Create stakeholder engagement + grievance mechanism docs (Spanish/English)."**

---

### 8. FINANCING (the close checklist)

26. **"Generate a lender-grade 'Conditions Precedent Checklist' for Financial Close with responsible party and target date."**

27. **"Draft the security package: pledge of shares, assignment of receivables, accounts waterfall, DSRA, step-in rights, mortgages, insurance endorsements."**

28. **"Generate a data room folder structure exactly as a bank expects, and map every document into it."**

29. **"Create a 'Sources & Uses' table and reconcile it against every model output."**

---

### 9. LEGAL + ACQUISITION (how money moves fast)

30. **"Draft the acquisition structure for $35M with $5M now and the remainder at 90 days: define escrow, CPs, reps/warranties, and termination triggers."**

31. **"Generate a version that also supports: $5M land-only purchase now and $30M for concession/SPV/permits later."**

32. **"Create a seller note alternative: $5M cash + $30M secured note with milestones."**

---

### 10. THE "SHOVEL-READY" VERDICT (force the AI to commit)

33. **"Give a binary classification: SHOVEL READY = YES/NO. If NO, list the minimum 7 items that must be completed to say YES without lying to an IC."**

34. **"Build the 'Readiness Engine Inputs' file so the OS score is computed strictly from evidence, not assumptions."**

# PART C — SPEED ASSESSMENT

## What You Already Have (Speed Enablers)

| Asset | Status | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Definitive concession (25-year) | ✅ Secured | Eliminates permitting risk |
| Environmental license (0379-20) | ✅ Secured | Clears environmental block |
| ETED no-objection + revalidation | ✅ Secured | Grid pathway confirmed |
| Clear land title (440.68 ha, appraised) | ✅ Secured | Title risk neutralized |
| Engineering layouts (50/100/140 MW) | ✅ Secured | Design readiness proven |
| Drone mapping (302 photos, KMZ/SRT) | ✅ Secured | Site intelligence locked |
| Corporate SPV in place | ✅ Secured | Entity ready for close |
| Incentive regime (Ley 57-07) | ✅ Identified | Tax advantage pathway |

> Most projects die before they even get here. This eliminates **permitting risk**, which is usually the slowest part.

---

## What Determines Speed Now

There are only **four real levers**:

### 1. Is There a Signed PPA?

| Scenario | Timeline Impact |
|---|---|
| PPA signed | Debt term sheets move in 30–60 days. Financial close 90–150 days realistic. |
| PPA unsigned | Everything becomes speculative. Timeline becomes "indefinite." |

> **This is the biggest accelerator.**

### 2. Is EPC Fixed-Price & Bankable?

Required evidence:
- Tier 1 EPC contractor identified
- Performance guarantees defined
- Liquidated damages coverage
- Warranty stack documented

> If EPC is still conceptual, you lose momentum.

### 3. Is Debt Identified or Just Modeled?

Speed depends on:
- Actual lender conversations
- Soft term sheet
- Mandated lead arranger

> If bank interest exists: fast. If not: expect 90–180 days for structuring.

### 4. Seller Alignment on $35M

- Milestone structure agreed?
- Escrow terms defined?
- Due diligence clean?
- Reps/warranties/earn-out friction?

---

## Realistic Timeline If Most Is Truly Done

**Conditions:** PPA signed, EPC fixed-price, debt term sheet in negotiation, no hidden title issues.

| Phase | Duration |
|---|---|
| Lender due diligence | 30–60 days |
| Financial close | 60–120 days |
| Notice to proceed | 120–150 days |
| **Construction start** | **4–6 months from today** |

> That's fast in infrastructure terms.

---

## What Would Slow It Down

Even with permits:

| Delay Vector | Risk Level |
|---|---|
| PPA not signed | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| Grid upgrade cost uncertainty | 🟡 HIGH |
| No committed debt | 🟡 HIGH |
| Political shift | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| Carbon revenue overestimated | 🟢 LOW (not load-bearing) |
| Seller not aligned | 🟡 HIGH |

> Infrastructure does not stall because of lack of documents. It stalls because of cash alignment.

---

## The Institutional Question

> **Are you structuring a deal or closing a deal?**
>
> Those are different universes.

- **Structuring** = Development phase. Timeline measured in quarters.
- **Closing** = Execution phase. Timeline measured in weeks.

The answer determines everything.

---

# PART D — FINAL OUTPUT REQUIRED

The system must produce these five scores, computed deterministically from evidence — not assumptions:

| # | Metric | Method |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Shovel-Ready Score (0–100)** | Weighted composite of all 15 interrogation sections |
| 2 | **Financial Close Readiness Score** | CP checklist completion × debt identification × PPA status |
| 3 | **Lender Acceptance Probability** | Binary assessment: is the package bankable today? |
| 4 | **Construction Start Probability (6 months)** | PPA × EPC × Debt × Title clarity |
| 5 | **Top 5 Blockers** | Ranked by severity with resolution path and timeline |

---

# PART E — THE THREE TOWERS

Financial close depends on exactly three towers. Everything else is derivative.

```
        ┌─────────────┐
        │   OFFTAKE    │  ← PPA / binding revenue contract
        │   TOWER      │
        └──────┬───────┘
               │
        ┌──────┴───────┐
        │    DEBT       │  ← Senior lender commitment
        │    TOWER      │
        └──────┬───────┘
               │
        ┌──────┴───────┐
        │    EPC        │  ← Fixed-price, bankable contract
        │    TOWER      │
        └──────┬───────┘
               │
        ┌──────┴───────┐
        │  FINANCIAL    │
        │    CLOSE      │
        └───────────────┘
```

If those three towers are aligned, this project moves from "platform says shovel-ready" to **investor-grade shovel-ready**.

If any tower is missing, the project is in development phase, not execution phase — regardless of how many permits, surveys, or layouts exist.
